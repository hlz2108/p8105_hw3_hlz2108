## Problem 0

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in order by user.

How many aisles, and which are most items ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot\! This plot shows the number of items ordered in each
aisle, limited to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table\! This table shows the three most popular items in
each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
vegetables fruits” and the number of times each item is ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs. Ice-Cream Making a second table. This table shows the mean
hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are
ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv", col_types = cols(
      week = col_integer(),
      day_id = col_integer()
      )) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekend = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Friday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "weekend",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "weekend"
)) %>% 
  relocate("weekend") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "activity_count") %>% 
  separate(activity, into = c("activity", "activity_minute")) %>%
  select(-activity) %>%
  mutate(
    activity_minute = as.numeric(activity_minute),
    day = factor(day),
    day = fct_relevel(day, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
    ) %>% view
```

The accel data set contains 50400 rows and 6 columns. The dataset
contains 5 weeks of accelerometer data collected from a 63 year-old male
with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care Center of
Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with congestive heart
failure (CHF). The variables in this dataset are weekend, week, day\_id,
day, activity\_minute, activity\_count. Below is a detailed description
of several variables of interest:

  - *day\_id* is a integer variable and indicates the day the
    accelerometer data was collected.

  - *week* is a integer variable and indicates the week the
    accelerometer data was collected.

  - *weekend* is a character variable that indicates whether the
    information was collected on a weekend vs. a weekday.

  - *activity\_minute* is a numeric variable that indicates the minute
    when the activity count was collected, corresponding to each minute
    of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(day_id, day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Activity counts were at their lowest on the two Saturdays prior to end
of data collection (weeks 4 and 5). The individual appears to be most
active on the days leading up to and after the weekend, and during the
weekend (Friday-Monday).

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_minute, y = activity_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "24-Hour Activity Count by Day",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Activity Count",
    caption = "Data from the accel dataset"
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 360, 720, 1080, 1440), 
    labels = c("12AM", "6AM", "12PM", "6PM", "11:59PM"),
    limits = c(0, 1440)
    ) + 
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(
      name = "Day",
      discrete = TRUE) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Activity is lowest during sleeping hours, the individual appears to be
more active on the weekends, in the evening hours around 8-10pm.
