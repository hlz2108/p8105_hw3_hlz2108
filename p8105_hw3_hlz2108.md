Below is the code for setup:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──

    ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.2     ✓ purrr   0.3.4

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Problem 2

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv", col_types = cols(
      week = col_integer(),
      day_id = col_integer()
      )) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekend = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Friday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "weekend",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "weekend"
)) %>% 
  relocate("weekend") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "activity_count") %>% 
  separate(activity, into = c("activity", "activity_minute")) %>%
  select(-activity) %>%
  mutate(activity_minute = as.integer(activity_minute)) %>% view
```

The accel data set contains 50400 rows and 6 columns. The dataset
contains 5 weeks of accelerometer data collected from a 63 year-old male
with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care Center of
Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with congestive heart
failure (CHF). The variables in this dataset are weekend, week, day\_id,
day, activity\_minute, activity\_count. Below is a detailed description
of several variables of interest:

  - *day\_id* is a integer variable and indicates the day the
    accelerometer data was collected.

  - *week* is a integer variable and indicates the week the
    accelerometer data was collected.

  - *weekend* is a character variable that indicates whether the
    information was collected on a weekend vs. a weekday.

  - *activity\_minute* is a integer variable that indicates the minute
    when the activity count was collected, corresponding to each minute
    of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
aggregate_accel_df = accel_df %>% 
  group_by(day_id, day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% view
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'day_id' (override with `.groups` argument)

Activity counts were at their lowest on the two Saturdays prior to end
of data collection (weeks 4 and 5).

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_minute, y = activity_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "24-Hour Activity Count by Day",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Activity Count",
    caption = "Data from the accel dataset"
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 360, 720, 1080, 1440), 
    labels = c("12AM", "6AM", "12PM", "6PM", "11:59PM"),
    limits = c(0, 1440)
    ) + 
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(
      name = "Day",
      discrete = TRUE) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
